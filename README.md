# o365api-android-get-events-appThis is my first ever Android app! Please be patient while I learn :-)It uses Office 365 Calendar API to get events from a users calendar in Office 365 for the day, wee, month.A. Current Functionality:1. Displays Calendar Events in a sectioned view2 Preferences define time interval to retrieve events (day, week, month)3 Preferences define the color tone of the eventslist4 Auto-refresh on preference change5 Slide down gesture for refresh6 Sign-In and Sign-Out to Office 365B. Fixes since last checkin1. Fixed crash on screen rotate and resume of app2. Get a new AccessToken for Office 365 Calendar API before every request to avoid token expirationC. Current bugsProbably many but cannot get app to crash right now. So call it a day for this checkin.D. Upcoming work:1. Add a local cache for faster boot-up time2. Do not re-query the Office 365 Calendar API on screen rotate
