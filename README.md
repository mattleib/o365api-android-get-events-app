# o365api-android-get-events-appThis is my first ever Android app! Please be patient while I learn :-)It uses Office 365 Calendar API to get events from a users calendar in Office 365 for the day, wee, month.A. Current Functionality:1. Displays Calendar Events in a sectioned view2. Preferences define time interval to retrieve events (today next 7 days, next 30 days)3. Preferences define if events in the past form current time should be included4. Preferences define the color tone of the eventslist5. Auto-refresh on preference change6. Slide down gesture for refresh7. Sign-In and Sign-Out to Office 365B. Fixes since last checkin1. New Preferences define if events in the past form current time should be included (minus 1 hour)2. UI fixes such as times in the list do not show seconds anymore, strings displayed during getting eents. etc.C. Current bugsWaiting for feedback ...D. Upcoming work1. Add a local cache for faster boot-up time (e.g. for offline viewing - incl. handling if no data connection)2. Add actions on event item to notify organizer on running late or can't make it
