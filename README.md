# o365api-android-get-events-appThis is my first ever Android app! Please be patient while I learn :-)It uses Office 365 Calendar API to get events from a users calendar in Office 365 for the day, wee, month.A. Current Functionality:1. Displays Calendar Events in a sectioned view2. Preferences define time interval to retrieve events (day, week, month)3. Preferences define the color tone of the eventslist4. Auto-refresh on preference change5. Slide down gesture for refresh6. Sign-In and Sign-Out to Office 365B. Fixes since last checkin1. Fixed issues with my events query2. Added visual cue for current event that is happening - tapping anywhere on the list refreshes visual cue3. Decided to return 100 events max to show some batching/paging with the APIC. Current bugsWaiting for feedback ...D. Upcoming work:1. Add a local cache for faster boot-up time
