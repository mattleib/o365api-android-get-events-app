# o365api-android-get-events-app
This is my first ever Android app! Please be patient while I learn :-)

It uses Office 365 Calendar API to get events from a users calendar in Office 365 for the day, wee, month.

Current Functionality:
-- Displays Calendar Events in a sectioned view
-- Preferences define 
---- the time interval to retrieve events (day, week, month)
---- the color tone of the eventslist
-- Auto-refresh on preference change
-- Slide down gesture for refresh
-- Sign-In and Sign-Out to Office 365

Current bugs
-- AutoRotate makes app crash :-(

Upcoming work:
-- Make AutoRotate work
-- Add a local cache for faster boot-up time
