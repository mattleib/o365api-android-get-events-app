# o365api-android-get-events-appThis is my first ever Android app! Please be patient while I learn :-)It uses Office 365 Calendar API to get events from a users calendar in Office 365 for the day, wee, month.A. Current Functionality:1. Displays Calendar Events in a sectioned view2. Preferences define time interval to retrieve events (day, week, month)3. Preferences define the color tone of the eventslist4. Auto-refresh on preference change5. Slide down gesture for refresh6. Sign-In and Sign-Out to Office 365B. Fixes since last checkin1. Fixed some more crashes on resume of the app2. Added logcat instrumentation to better find my bugs3. Get a new AccessToken for Office 365 Calendar API actually works now.4. Rotating screen and resume does not re-query eventsC. Current bugsWaiting for feedback ...D. Upcoming work:1. Add a local cache for faster boot-up time
