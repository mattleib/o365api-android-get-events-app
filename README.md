# o365api-android-get-events-appThis is my first ever Android app! Please be patient while I learn :-)It uses Office 365 Calendar API to get events from a users calendar in Office 365 for the day, wee, month.A. Current Functionality:1. Displays Calendar Events in a sectioned view2. Preferences define 3. the time interval to retrieve events (day, week, month)4. the color tone of the eventslist5. Auto-refresh on preference change6. Slide down gesture for refresh7. Sign-In and Sign-Out to Office 365B. Current bugs1. AutoRotate and resume makes app crash :-(C. Upcoming work:1. Make AutoRotate work2. Add a local cache for faster boot-up time
